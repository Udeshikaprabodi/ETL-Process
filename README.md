Airline Dataset ETL Pipeline

Overview

This project demonstrates the creation of a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using an airline dataset. The pipeline processes data related to flight delays, cleans and transforms it, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database for further analysis. The project is designed to automate data ingestion and transformation tasks for reporting or machine learning purposes.

Features

Data Extraction: Reads raw data from CSV files.
Data Transformation: Cleans the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and categorizing delays.
Data Loading: Inserts the processed data into a PostgreSQL database.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation
psycopg2: For database connectivity
Database: PostgreSQL
